# Mathematics

I will here list some kind of glossary to, at least, know the basics.

- **Monotonic function**: a function that preserves or reverses the order of a given set, i.e. non-increasing or non-decreasing
- **Continuous function**: a function for which, for a continuous (non-jump) increase in the x, we have a continuous (non-jump) increase in the y
- **Convex function**: a function for which the line segment, between any two points of the function, never lies below the graph between the two points
